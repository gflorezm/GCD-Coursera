# Coursera *Getting and Cleaning Data* course project
### Author: Guillermo Florez Montero <br />

This is the final project of the Getting and Cleaning Data course at Coursera - Johns Hopkins University. In this project, we collected data from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The data was processed to create a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.

The source data set was obtained from the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

Data Zip File Location: [UC Irvine Repo](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip "Clicking will download the data")


## Goals of the Project
1. Create a tidy data set 
2. Link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis 
3. Create a Code Book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
4. Create the Analysis R Script
